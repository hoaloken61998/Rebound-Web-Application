# Rebound Piercing – E-Commerce Website  

## 📖 Overview  
The global demand for body piercings is rising, especially among Gen Z, who view it as a form of self-expression. However, in Vietnam, the market still faces challenges related to professional standards, hygiene, and customer trust.  

To address this, our team developed **Rebound Piercing**, an e-commerce website that provides a premium shopping and booking experience for piercing jewelry and services.  

The platform allows users to:  
- 🛒 Browse and purchase premium piercing jewelry  
- 📅 Book piercing services online with scheduling and reminders  
- 👤 Manage accounts, orders, and aftercare guides  
- 🖥️ For admins: Manage products, orders, customers, and appointments through a secure dashboard  

Our goal is to blend **safety, aesthetics, and convenience** while supporting Rebound Piercing’s growth into Vietnam’s premium jewelry & piercing brand.
